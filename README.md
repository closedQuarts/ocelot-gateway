# Ocelot API Gateway

This repository contains the Ocelot API Gateway configuration used to route all chat-related backend API requests. The gateway is hosted on Render and handles routing to .NET-based billing services.

## Features

- Handles requests for:
  - /api/bill/{subscriberId}
  - /api/bill/detailed
  - /api/bill/pay
- Configured using Ocelot (ocelot.json)
- Hosted on Render
- Uses JWT token validation where needed

## Challenges Encountered

- Coordinating communication between the React frontend, Firebase functions, and the Ocelot API Gateway required precise endpoint and method alignment.
- Managing CORS and authorization headers when calling the gateway from cloud functions.
- Parsing natural language reliably using OpenAI and designing consistent JSON outputs for varying user intents.
- Handling asynchronous behavior between Firestore message writes and delayed function triggers.
- Configuring Firebase project permissions to allow the frontend to write and read from Firestore.
- Debugging unexpected 401 and 404 errors from the gateway during early integration.
